# Project1-Mastermind

Overview and Brief

This was a solo project built in 9 days, during week 4 of my General Assembly course. Our brief was to build a game using a grid-system created using JavaScript. I choose to build Mastermind as it is a classic game I enjoyed playing growing up, and still enjoy today.

The Game

Mastermind is a code breaking game whereby the player has to unlock a colour code consisting of 4 colours in order, chosen from a possible 8 colours. After each guess, the player receives feedback consisting of red and white pegs. A red peg indicates the correct colour in the correct column. A white peg indicates the correct colour, but in the wrong column.

The aim of the game is to guess the code in the fewest possible guesses. Below is an image of how my Mastermind board looks when the game begins.
